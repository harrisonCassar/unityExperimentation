# unity_ACMGameStudio
Repository for my Unity projects and files in association with my involvement in UCLA's ACM Game Studio program.

By the end of the 2018-2019 academic year, this repository will include a fully-completed and coded game of any genre or type in Unity. Harrison Cassar will be the lead programmer of the game itself, and will be on a team of other students that are all working as a team to complete the previously mentioned Unity game.
